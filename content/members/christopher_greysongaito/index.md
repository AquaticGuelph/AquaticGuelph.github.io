I am fascinated by systems; how they function, what structures them, and 
what causes them to fail. My favourite systems are ecological systems 
and my specific research focus is ecological food webs. However, I see 
myself as highly interdisciplinary and am interested in the intersection 
of ecology with evolution, politics, and economics. My main research 
tool is mathematical modelling, but I also collaborate with empiricists 
regularly.

 For my PhD, I am examining the interactions of ecological processes 
across scales in a variety of systems. One part of my PhD will examine 
how the stabilization of farming yields through fertilization and 
pesticide use can translate into instability in farming profits. Another 
part of my PhD will examine the dynamics of resident gut microbial 
communities (microbiomes).
