I am a PhD student in the McCann Lab, co-advised by Evan Fraser from the Department of Geography. I use theory to understand ecosystem functioning in order to preserve both ecological stability and food production in the face of global change (e.g., climate change, land development and food production/harvesting). My research develops general theory that can be applied to many ecosystem types, from temperate rivers to tropical flood plains to coral reefs. My past research has focused on patterns in global fisheries and resulting food web dynamics.
