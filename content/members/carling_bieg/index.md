I am a PhD student in the McCann Lab, co-advised by Evan Fraser from the Department of Geography. I use theory to understand ecosystem functioning in order to preserve both ecological stability and food production in the face of global change (e.g., climate change, land development and food production/harvesting). My past research has focused on patterns in global fisheries and resulting food web dynamics, and I am now extending this by developing general theory that can be applied to many ecosystem types, from temperate rivers to tropical flood plains and coral reefs.
