### Research interests

I am a visiting postdoctoral researcher from the [Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences](https://www.slu.se/cv/torbjorn-saterberg/). My research addresses both fundamental questions and more applied questions within the field of food web ecology. To this end, I combine theoretical analyses with data driven approaches, such as time series analyses. My major areas of research include:
* Regime shifts and early warning signals
* Development of novel tools for sustainable exploitation of interacting fish stocks
* Ecological networks


### Current project

As of 2018 I am a funded through a mobility grant from the Swedish Research Council FORMAS (grant nr. 2017-00433). The project involves development of novel time series methods for: (i) investigating regime shifts; (ii) estimating sustainable exploitation levels of interacting fish populations.
