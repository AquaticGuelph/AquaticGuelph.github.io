I am an MSc candidate in the McCann Lab, studying spatial and temporal population dynamics of zooplankton in Lake Simcoe, ON. I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Guelph in Marine and Freshwater Biology with a minor in Ecology. Throughout my degree, I became interested in lake food web ecology through working on Lake Huron as a field and lab technician in the McCann Lab. Currently, I am looking at how variation in densities of the Lake Simcoe zooplankton community have changed since 1986. I am interested in understanding how wind dynamics influence the spatial distribution of zooplankton and fish communities in lake food webs.
