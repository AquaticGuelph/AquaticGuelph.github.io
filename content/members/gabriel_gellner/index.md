I study the structure and functions of food webs to better understand our environment and biological
complexity. Topics include theoretical ecology, population biology and how biodiversity affects
ecological systems. As well, Iâ€™m interested in where the ideas and methods of theoretical ecology
and ecoinformatics come from, and how they are applied. For more details visit my [website](http://gabrielgellner.com).
