I joined the McCann lab as a post-doctoral fellow in May 2018.
My research uses field- and lab-based approaches to understand
how behaviour and physiology interact to shape the responses
of species and their ecosystems to environmental change, with
a focus on freshwater fish.

I previously completed my PhD at the University of Manitoba with
Dr. Paul Blanchfield and my MSc with Dr. Aaron Fisk and
Dr. Douglas Haffner at the University of Windsor.
