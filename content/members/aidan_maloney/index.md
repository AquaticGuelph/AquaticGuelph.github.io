I am an MSc candidate in the McCann Lab, studying the relationship between bat activity and agricultural intensity in southwestern Ontario. This will broadly examine how a perturbation to the landscape, through homogenization, may result in a loss of asynchronous resource availability for a highly mobile generalist consumer. I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Guelph, majoring in Ecology. I became interested in community ecology after taking the course Populations, Communities, and Ecosystems, which opened my eyes to the interconnectedness and balanced nature of biodiversity.
