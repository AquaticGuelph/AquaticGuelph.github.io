In the McCann Lab, I am completing a thesis based masters in Integrative Biology at the University of Guelph. While completing my undergraduate degree in Wildlife Biology and Conservation with a math minor, I became fascinated by how species coexistence can be modelled mathematically. Within my MSc, I am using theory to understand how seasonality may drive species coexistence. By altering seasonal lengths to resemble global warming, my research aims to investigate if and how competitive species can coexist in the face of climate change
