Maybe we could have a page for this / create a wiki for the lab. A couple of useful links:

- [gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
- first chapters of [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/fr/v2) are worth reading
- [Markdown](https://insileco.github.io/2018/05/13/markdown-everywhere/)
- [choosealicense](https://choosealicense.com/)
- [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
- [large file](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-large-files/)
