### Context

As in many other discipline, in ecology, coding has become an important skill
and as the complexity of statical increases s more and more likely that a [PhD candidate
needs to learn programing](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v541/n7638/full/nj7638-563a.html)

Writing our code, we had feature expand and we need to track our
code [share our code for reproducibility purposes](https://www.nature.com/news/why-scientists-must-share-their-research-code-1.20504)


[git](https://git-scm.com/) is a powerful tool to track changes and for with colleagues
on the. Tecnhically speaking it is a Distributed Version Control Systems](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)

To ease the display the monitor of coding and web servcie on the top of Git
[Github](). Note that [there are may alternative](https://www.ubuntupit.com/10-github-alternatives-for-hosting-your-open-source-projects/)
some of them such as gitlab ()let you deploy the service on your own server.
Git introduces several concepts and it is actually quite puzzling at the begingin
that why the reading of [a tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
or [a book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is quite necessary.  



### A Simple Git + GitKraken + Github Workflow

Below is the basic workflow that was presented during the Git
lab meeting (24/10/2018) by Gabe:

<!-- I guess there are tutorials availabe on line, maybe we can add a link -->

- Initialize a new repository on GitHub
- **Clone** the repo to your local machine
- Add some files / folders using your operating systems file browser
- list files that should not be versioned in `.gitignore`
- Make a commit
    1. **Stage** files to include in the commit
    2. _Optional_: ignore some files / folders that should not be checked in to commit
    3. Add a commit message (don't be that person that leaves this blank), short -- tweet
       like summary of what has changed. Good for looking back at the history of the project
    4. **Push** the commit back to Github (sync your local version with the version on Github)


Comments:

- how to sync your git?
- avoid versioning [large files](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-large-files/)
- it is important to add a license to your repository, [choosealicence.com](https://choosealicense.com/)
will give you valuable advice.
