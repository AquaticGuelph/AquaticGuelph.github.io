Maybe we could have a page for this / create a wiki for the lab. A couple of useful links:

- [gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
- first chapters of [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/fr/v2) are worth reading
- [Markdown](https://insileco.github.io/2018/05/13/markdown-everywhere/)
- [choosealicense](https://choosealicense.com/)
- [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
- [large file](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-large-files/)

## A Simple Git Workflow
- Initialize a new repo on GitHub
- **Clone** the repo to your local machine
- Add some files / folders using your operating systems file browser
- Make a commit
    1. **Stage** files to include in the commit
    2. _Optional_: ignore some files / folders that should not be checked in to commit
    3. Add a commit message (don't be that person that leaves this blank), short -- tweet
       like summary of what has changed. Good for looking back at the history of the project
    4. **Push** the commit back to Github (sync your local version with the version on Github)
