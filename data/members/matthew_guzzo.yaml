role: Post-doctoral fellow

I joined the McCann lab as a post-doctoral fellow in May 2018. My research uses field- and lab-based approaches to understand how behaviour and physiology interact to shape the responses of species and their ecosystems to environmental change, with a focus on freshwater fish.

I previously completed my PhD at the University of Manitoba with Dr. Paul Blanchfield and my MSc with Dr. Aaron Fisk and Dr. Douglas Haffner at the University of Windsor.
