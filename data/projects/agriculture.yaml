text: "My lab is part of a large project at the University of Guelph that is looking at different farming techniques, both on land and in water, impact the ecosystems that are adjacent to them. By 2050, the planet will have 9.6 billion people on it and the need to produce food in a sustainable manner â€“ both sustainable in terms of efficient crop production and also in terms of land use and biodiversity conservation in natural ecosystem. Although this is a very general project that seeks to understand how farming type influences adjacent ecosystem services, we are focusing on the influence of farming intensity and style on lake, river and stream ecosystems."
