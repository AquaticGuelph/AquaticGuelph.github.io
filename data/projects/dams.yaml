text: "Floodplains like the Tonle Sap in Cambodia are strongly seasonally forced ecosystems and as such are wonderful models for considering the role of how structure changes with season. Additionally, these systems are threatened to change in many ways due to mounting human impacts like dams and climate change that will alter the strength of longstanding seasonal cycles (e.g., in precipitation and flooding)."
