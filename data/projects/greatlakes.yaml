text: "The Great lakes are iconic examples of ecosystems under threat of human impacts. Invasive species, water levels, micro-plastics, nutrient run-off, you name it, have been argued to influence these ecosystems. This range of stressors likely play a variety of roles in restructuring the community/food web and ecosystem attributes of these important lakes. Here, our work has become interested in using Biotracers and other empirical measurements that can monitor individual responses (physiology, behavior) to whole ecosystem responses to natural conditions and human-impacted conditions.  While organizations like the Stockholm resilience Centre have focused on Global metrics to look at human impacts, this work in a sense takes a similar approach but focuses on the unit of management, the ecosystem. The hope is to develop easy to measure ecological assays that harness existing and developing biotechnology (DNA barcoding, fatty acids) to rapidly biomonitor things in time and space. This leads to another area we are working in the McCann lab and that is the development of Biotracers in Science and Applications, both from theoretical and empirical viewpoint as well as a purely methodological viewpoint."
