text: "The budworm cycle is known and well studied. Nonetheless, the major factors governing the size and extent of budworms remains a mystery. We are part of a collaborative effort with Dr. Eldon Eveleigh to decompose the roles different aspects play in mediating the cycle. This research again is interested in how structures vary in response to the major and relatively predictable shifts in budworm in the Boreal forest."
